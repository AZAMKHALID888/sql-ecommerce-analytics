# Key Insights (sample, based on included rows)

- **MAC** rises from June to July given repeat orders from customer 1 and first orders from customers 3–4.
- **Revenue mix** skewed to **Electronics** (high ticket items: product 13 at 800/unit).
- **Cohorts**: the June cohort (first buyers in June) shows **repeat in July** (customer 1), indicating early retention.
- **Conversion**: sessions observed before orders; crude conversion improves in July (more orders per session).
- **Anomalies**: with a short series, no significant Z-score spikes yet; add data to make this meaningful.

_Recommendation_: Expand with 2–3 more months, add cancellations/refunds variety, and track CAC proxies by `source` to evaluate channel ROI.
